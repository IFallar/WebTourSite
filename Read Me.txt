This is the Midterm project of our Group

A Mock of our Website: "WEBTOUR:CALABARZON"

For this, our group has chosen to go with 
a direct HTML/CSS mock-up along with some JS.

The contents of the mock-up are as follows:

> The Homepage
> The Provinces Page
> The Destinations Page
> The Experiences Page
> The About Us Page

	Also included are 5 Article pages:

	 > Article Page for Cavite Province

	 > Article Page for Kamay ni Hesus Destination
	 > Article Page for Aguinaldo Shrine Destination

	 > Article Page for Hiking in Cavite Experience
	 > Article Page for Diving in Batangas Experience
